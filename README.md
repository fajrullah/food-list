# Front-End for food list
Welcome to our Front-End Food Repository, your go-to source for a visually pleasing and user-friendly display of delectable food.

This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules, and TypeScript.

> **Note:** Since tests can be co-located alongside other files inside the App Router, Those have been placed in `app/` to demonstrate this behavior (which is different than `pages/`). We can place all tests in `__tests__`.
